Kotlin solves the problem of nullables by checking for null types at compile time rather than run time

If you use regular types like "String" you can only store non-nullable values

To store nullable values you have to add "?" at the end of the data type example "String?" hence now you can either store a null or non null value

If you try accessing non-nullable type's access its members or call on it its extension functions there is no problem.
